- Architecture: Use of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for a clean and maintainable code structure.
- Database: MongoDB, managed through Mongoose to facilitate interaction with the NoSQL database.
- Containers: Docker Compose to manage services and dependencies, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
- Deployment: Deployment on the cloud using AWS, leveraging its scalability and reliability.
